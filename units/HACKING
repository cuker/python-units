To hack on this module, you should get:

 * Mercurial (hg)
 * pylint
 * py.test
 * epydoc
 * figleaf
 * Unix

To run the tests, doctests, and generate a figleaf coverage report:

    py.test -p doctest --doctest-modules -p figleaf -F --figleaf-html figleaf-html units

Note that figleaf crashes on some tests if they fail. 

To generate the html documentation, run:

    epydoc units

To check the style of the code, run:

    pylint units

To make this file's HTML version (if you have markdown installed):

    markdown units/HACKING -f units/HACKING.html

To do it all:

<!-- 
    exit
-->

    units/HACKING
